#Concept

A website where users can upload audio files (.mp3, .wav, etc..) and enter a keyword. The app will process the audio file and return the timestamps of the keyword.

##[Problem]

Podcasts are increasing in popularity, and sharing digital content is at an all time high. There is no efficient way to find specific parts of podcasts when you want to find/listen/share something that you have heard in the past but canâ€™t remember the exact part. Skipping through with the 15 seconds skip button is unreliable.

##[Solution]

A platform that generates timestamps of audio files based on keywords.
